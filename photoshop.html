<p>Oigres and Yago were rescued by aliens and live on the moon. Thereâ€™s always music on the moon, all kinds, no one really knows where it comes from. Everyone dances to wherever they need to go, except Oigres, he rides his dog everywhere. Oigres lives in a treehouse with his dog and several other animals, everyone else live underground, apartments, spaceships, anything goes on the moon but in a good way. The weather is perfect. Oigres can communicate with animals and has trained them to acquire all of his neccesities.</p>
